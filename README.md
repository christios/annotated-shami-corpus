# annotated-shami-corpus

This repository will contain the data which was annotated in the scope of my master's thesis which revolves around the standardization of orthography for Arabic dialects. It consists of a Lebanese Arabic corpus annotated for numerous morphological features and for orthography standardization. This [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VA4PZ1UKKQmpJXi0JYkh8miuOsNMDk-U/view?usp=sharing) takes you to the report of the thesis where the annotation process and corpus statistics are described in detail in Chapter 3 (Lebanese Arabic Corpus Annotation).
